                            Discover716 is <span class="textlight">non-profit organization</span> with a two-pronged mission. First, we want to help small businesses and the non-profit community thrive by helping them market themselves and building their brand recognition, knowing that many are resource-constrained, especially due to the pandemic. Second, we are creating internships for college students in a collaborative work environment to help these small businesses and non-profits.
                            College students across a multitude of disciplines – <span class="textlight">marketing, technology, graphic arts, journalism </span>, and so on – gain invaluable experience with Discover716 helping meet the needs of our “clients.” Mentors help guide the students, but the students have tremendous latitude to tap their creativity and build their portfolio as they worked to build the brand of those who needed our assistance.
                            Your contribution is essential to helping us fulfill our mission!
